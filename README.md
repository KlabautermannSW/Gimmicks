This repository contains some projects that are to small to have an own repository. But they are nice and may be helpful to somebody out there :-)

## Coder ##
Coding HTML &lt;mailto> tag into numeric character references. It's a little useful to reduce spam on a mail address given on a website.

## microTelCon ##
Reads data from Conrad digital temperature time module (No 19 55 88) and sends the data converted onto two bytes via RS232. It's some hardware and some software in this little project that works for me unfailing since 2006!
